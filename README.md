## Using GameControl to save:

In order to use the GameControl script, attach the script
to an empty object for every scene in the game. The object
should persist between scenes correctly.

You can access any of the public methods in GameControl
such as the getter/setter methods. GameControl currently
supports saving and loading as well as resource 
adjusting (IncResources & DecResources).
